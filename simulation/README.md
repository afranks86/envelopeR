This folder includes scripts to generate all of the simulation plots included in Biometrics paper.

- Figure 2b can be generated from `covariates_2b.R`
- `goodness_of_fit_S3.R`
- `initialization_S2.R`
- `plot_simulation_results.R`
- `scalability_S1.R` .  I recommend using the cloud, as the number of replicates, features and sample sizes fit in this simulation mean that the script takes several days to complete.
